I am starting to learn more about how Jekyll works, and I have a local version of Jekyll running on my machine so I can preview the changes I made before I push them to the site.

Honestly, this whole thing wasn't *too* steep of a learning curve and I am starting to really like this. The best part is there is plenty of documentation out there about it.

Alright, I'm going to bed. It's late/early.
